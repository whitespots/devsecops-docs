# 🚀 Run Audit

You can run the Auditor through the AppSec Portal

* [Manually](../../../appsec-portal/features/vulnerability-discovery/run-audit/run-audit-manually.md)
* [By setting up a schedule](../../../appsec-portal/features/vulnerability-discovery/run-audit/scheduled-audit-run.md)

Findings detected by the Auditor will be [displayed](../../../appsec-portal/features/findings-view/) in the AppSec Portal

{% hint style="info" %}
If findings are detected during scanning, they will be automatically submitted to the AppSec Portal when **all** scanners in the sequence have completed their work
{% endhint %}
