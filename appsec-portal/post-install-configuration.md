## Import automation rules

Ask our team to send you the latest ruleset if we haven't done it for some reason :smile:

## Configure Version Control integration

This step will be the last one if you want to just scan your repositories, validate issues, remove duplicates from different scanners.

Here's [our guide](general-portal-settings/version-control.md)

But keep in mind, that you will see only those repositories, which developers commit into.

## Import repositories

If you want to scan all repositories by manual trigger - import them using this instruction and be ready to perform scans. [This is the guide](post-install-configuration.md#import-repositories)

## Perform scans

Please follow [this guide ](auditor/run-audit/run-audit-manually.md)
