It provides comprehensive insights into potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and threats within your AWS infrastructure, enabling you to strengthen your security measures and ensure compliance with industry best practices.

You can send reports using the Importing reports via AWS Lambda Function within AWS Security Hub. This [**guide** ](importing-reports-via-aws-lambda-function-within-aws-security-hub.md)will walk you through the process of efficiently importing reports to enhance your security monitoring capabilities.
