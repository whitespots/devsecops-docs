If nessasary to complete a survey for each product to determine **business criticality**:

{% hint style="info" %}
The **default** value for business criticality is **10**. Unless you set a different value, any product is considered to be <mark style="color:red;">highly critical</mark>. Please adjust criticality level so that your metrics reflect a more realistic [risk trend](../security-metrics/wrt-weighted-risk-trend.md).
{% endhint %}

To view the results of the **risk assessment tests**, navigate to the **Risk Assessment Overview** page. Here, the chosen answers in these tests or manually settings are displayed for each product, along with the calculated business criticality value based on those answers.
