### Risk appetite

Set your **general** **risk appetite** and **risk appetite  per product**:

* The _general WRT_ is calculated from the sum of the risks of all the applications. So **General** **Risk appetite value** is the general WRT value that seems acceptable to the business and should be considered as a general KPI.
* **Risk appetite per product** sets a value for each product development team, this risk appetite is their target metric (up to this value they need to reduce their risk trend).
