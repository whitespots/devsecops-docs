# Grouping of findings into groups

You can create your own groups in the portal and consolidate your findings into the groups you have created. \
The findings are assigned a group name and you can filter all findings by this parameter.\
Multiple groups can be assigned to a single finding

You can assign a group to a finding either **directly** or using the [**bulk action**](available-bulk-actions.md).
