# Custom Jira description

This feature is designed to provide a developer with a readable description instead of a technical one from the scanner.

For instance, technical descriptions can be cluttered and difficult to understand, such as the display of a private RSA key. With the Custom Jira description feature, there are two options available - Append and Replace - for modifying the description.

* **Append:** text from the text box will be added to the existing description on the next line.
* **Replace:** text from the text box will completely replace the scanner description.
