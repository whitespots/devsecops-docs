# Auto Closer

This setting allows users to specify a fallback action if a previously identified finding is not present in a new scanner report (for example, if that vulnerability has been fixed). Click the **Resolve** or **Delete** button to decide whether to automatically resolve such finding or delete it from the Portal.
