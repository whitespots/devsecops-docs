# Custom severity mapping

If a scanner has the same severity types as AppSec Portal, then this option is not required.&#x20;

However, if the scanner has its _own_ severity types in its reports, they can be mapped to the Portal types. If other severity types are not mapped (and you probably want to combine them into one), they can be assigned to any of the portal's types as the **default** severity.
