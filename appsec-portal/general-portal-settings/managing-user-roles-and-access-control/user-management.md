# User management

This page provides an overview of the user management features and guides on performing various user-related tasks.

User management in the AppSec Portal is performed in the "**Users**" page, which can be accessed through the "**Users and Roles**" tab.

{% hint style="warning" %}
User management tasks, such as adding, editing, deleting and assigning roles to users, can only be performed by roles that have been granted the "**Can manage roles and users**" permission. Ensure that the role assigned to your account has this permission in order to access and manage user accounts.
{% endhint %}
